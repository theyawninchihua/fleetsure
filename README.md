# FleetSure Protocol v1.0
## Vehicle Selection
All vehicles are evaluated with standard equipment, in addition some vehicles may be evaluated with optional equipment. Only vehicles with at least one rear seating row are evaluated. The vehicle **model**, **variant**, **date of evaluation** and **protocol version** uniquely identify a result; change in any one could lead to a different result.

## Evaluation criteria
| star rating | minimum primary safety | minimum secondary safety |
| -----------:| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 5 stars     | 90%                    | 90%                      |
| 4 stars     | 70%                    | 70%                      |
| 3 stars     | 50%                    | 50%                      |
| 2 stars     | 30%                    | 30%                      |
| 1 star      | 10%                    | 10%                      |
| 0 stars     | 0%                     | 0%                       |

### Primary Safety (20 points)
#### Electronic Stability Control (max. 8 points)
- 8 points are awarded if electronic stability control is fitted.
#### Blind Spot Monitoring (max. 2 points)
- 2 points are divided equally over each side of the vehicle that has a blind spot monitoring system that achieves at least one of:
    - relays a camera feed of the rear blind spot to the driver when the turn signal for that side is engaged
    - activates a visual or audio warning when there is a vehicle in the rear blind spot
#### Driver Monitoring System (max. 2 points)
- 2 points are awarded if the vehicle has a camera-based fatigue detection system designed to detect drowsiness.
#### Tyre Pressure Monitoring (max. 2 points)
- 2 points are awarded for a direct or indirect tyre pressure monitoring system that has a deflation warning.
#### Tactile Controls (max. 6)
- 6 points are awarded, 1 each for having physical (non-haptic) buttons for each of the following functions:
    - hazard lights
    - turn signals
    - windscreen wipers
    - gear selection
    - air conditioning
    - music and navigation

    To determine ambiguous cases, the heuristic used is: award the point if the control can be located using tactile memory.

### Secondary Safety (30 points)
#### Rear Seatbelts (max. 4 points)
- 4 points are awarded if all rear seats have an three-point seatbelt with automatic retractor.
#### Rear Seatbelt Reminders (max. 10 points)
- 2 points are awarded if all rear seats have an audio or visual seatbelt status indication for seatbelt status.
- 8 points are divided equally over each rear seat (including a third row if fitted) that:
    - has occupant detection, and
    - activates passively, i.e., a belt need not first *change status* from fastened to unfastened for either signal to start
#### Side Head Protection (max. 6 points)
- 3 points are awarded if both front seats have a side head protection airbag (e.g. curtain or combination thorax-head).
- 2 points are awarded if all rows are covered by a curtain airbag.
- 1 point is awarded for a centre airbag between the front seats.
#### Side Chest Protection (max. 3 points)
- 2 points are awarded if both front seats have a side thorax airbag.
- 1 point is awarded if both second row outboard seats have a side thorax airbag.
#### Head Restraints (max. 4 points)
- 4 points are awarded if all rear seats have a sufficiently sized head restraint (the assessment of “sufficiently sized” will be made subjectively; adjustable are default pass).
#### ISOFIX (max. 3 points)
- 1 point is awarded for every ISOFIX or i-Size position. If a frontal airbag is fitted to a seat, deactivation must be possible without a dealer visit (maximum points are capped at 3).
